Visioneer: Dynamic Assistant

This project was created to help the visually impaired obtain more mobility where they are first person. Visioneer is built from OpenAI, Hume, and computer vision computations. Given an input from a patient, the patient can ask where the nearest object is even if they are considered blind.
